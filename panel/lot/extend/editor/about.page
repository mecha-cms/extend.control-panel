_CodeMirror_ is a versatile text editor implemented in JavaScript for the browser. It is specialized for editing code, and comes with a number of language modes and addons that implement more advanced editing functionality.

A rich programming API and a CSS theming system are available for customizing _CodeMirror_ to fit your application, and extending it with new functionality.

---

Add `editor` or `CM` class to a text area element to enable the editor, add a `data-type` attribute as the _CodeMirror_ mode:

~~~ .html
<textarea class="editor width height" data-type="CSS">body {}</textarea>
~~~

Or use `editor` type in the Panel API:

~~~ .php
return [
    'type' => 'editor',
    'value' => 'body {}',
    'attributes' => [
        'data' => [
            'type' => 'CSS'
        ]
    ]
];
~~~
